		<h2 id="aboutme">About me - Yufei Song</h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Yufei Song. I am an outgoing and thoughtful 
		person who enjoys working with others and finding creative ways 
		to solve challenges. I value communication and collaboration, and 
		I try to bring positivity and energy into the projects I take part 
		in. Living and studying abroad has also made me adaptable and open-minded, 
		and I always look forward to new experiences and opportunities to learn.</p>
		<h2 id="academic">Academic Background</h2>
		<p>I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies at New York 
		University, where I have been able to explore a wide range of courses 
		across media, communication, and global studies. My academic journey 
		has given me the chance to engage with both theoretical and practical 
		perspectives, from analyzing cultural trends to developing creative 
		projects. In Fall 2025, I will continue my studies at NYU London, an 
		opportunity that will broaden my perspective through new courses and 
		an international learning environment.
