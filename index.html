		<h2 id="intro">Introduction of the Class</h2>
		<p>This course introduces the fundamentals of web design, focusing on how to 
		build and structure web pages using HTML. Students will learn how to apply 
		semantic elements, create navigation links, and organize content into meaningful sections.
		By the end of the course, you will understand the essential building blocks of a 
		website and be prepared to continue developing your skills with styling in CSS and 
		interactivity through JavaScript.</p>
		<h2 id="goal">My Goal of the Class</h2>
		<p>My goal for this class is to gain a solid understanding of how websites 
		are built from the ground up using HTML. I want to become confident in writing 
		clean and well-structured code, so that I can share my ideas online in a clear 
		and accessible way. By the end of the course, I hope to create a personal website 
		that reflects my interests and can serve as the foundation for more advanced 
		projects in the future.
